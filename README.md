# Data-Science-Salary-Analysis
[Analysis of data science salary data.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/haseebkn/data-science-salaries-eda-insights)

The data set contains information on years of work, level of experience, type of employment, type of employment, amount of salary, country of residence of the employee, percentage of working from home, location and size of the company.

In this project, I analyzed the salaries of data scientists. 
I performed exploratory analysis and examined variable distributions. Using different diagrams, I drew conclusions about the data. 
I also answered questions such as:
       -Which country has the highest data science salaries? 
       -In which country do most people work full-time? 

Additionally, I explored the relationships between variables, used linear and polynomial regression for salary prediction, and applied K-means and DBSCAN algorithms for data clustering.
